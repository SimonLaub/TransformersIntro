Joao Fernando Ferreira Goncalves<br>
original material that can be found here:<br>

<br>
Changes to the original notebook was made, according to<br>
to talks with Joao, after Mads and I visited<br>
Rotterdam Universiteit in January 2024.<br>
<br>
Intended use of the 2 Notebooks:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Try to run the complete notebook (1), as it is.</li>
  <li>Then re-run notebook, that is (2), but now with more texts added, and see what<br>
  happens as information from these new texts are queried.</li>
</ol>

<br>
<a href="Transformers_train_your_own_language_model_02.ipynb">Notebook 2</a><br>
<br>
<br>In Notebook 2 you must add your own texts to the training.<br>
It is demonstrated that training for 5 epochs with the text <a href="Proshop.txt">Proshop.txt</a><br>
gives improved performance for questions relating to that text.<br>
Try adding additional texts in order to further improve the performance.<br>
